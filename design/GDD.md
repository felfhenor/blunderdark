# Blunderdark

*A dungeon creation and management sim.*

# Mission Statement

Create an interesting fantasy dungeon with room placements and unique inhabitants, finding interesting synergies to make a functioning dungeon ecosystem where multiple valid strategies exist.

---

# Core Philosophy

**Anti-Optimization Design Pillars:**
1. **Dynamic Adjacency** - Room effects change based on neighbors, creating spatial puzzles
2. **Conditional Bonuses** - Inhabitants gain bonuses from specific contexts, not just room types
3. **Resource Tension** - Multiple currencies compete for investment, no single path dominates
4. **Temporal Variance** - Day/night cycles, seasons, and events shift optimal strategies
5. **Emergent Synergies** - Interactions between 3+ elements create unexpected combinations

---

# Game Features

* Create an underground dungeon across multiple floors with unique biomes
* Each room has tetromino-inspired shapes (cannot rotate)
* Connect rooms with hallways (upgradeable with features)
* **Adjacency matters**: Rooms affect neighbors with fear, inspiration, contamination, or resonance
* Assign workers with unique traits that activate conditionally
* Upgrade rooms through branching paths (mutually exclusive choices)
* Navigate day/night cycles that affect production and inhabitant behavior
* Manage floor depth bonuses and penalties
* Defend your dungeon with strategic trap and creature placement
* Fuse inhabitants to create hybrid specialists
* **Seasonal events** change resource values and spawn special visitors
* **Dungeon reputation** affects what creatures you can recruit

- **High Harmony Reputation:** All rooms -10%, but cannot build high-corruption rooms

---

## Room Balance Strategy

**Design Intent:**

1. **Early game (Days 1-30):** Limited selection forces experimentation with basic rooms
2. **Mid game (Days 31-100):** Unlock Tier 2, create specialized strategies
3. **Late game (Days 101+):** Tier 3 rooms enable powerful combinations but require significant investment

**Balance Levers:**

- **Cost scaling** prevents single room spam
- **Build limits** force diverse room types
- **Unlock gates** create progression curve
- **Floor restrictions** encourage vertical expansion
- **Biome restrictions** make each floor unique
- **Cooldowns** prevent rapid power spikes

**Player Choice Preservation:**

Despite limits, players can still pursue different strategies:
- **Undead army:** Prioritize Soul Wells (max 2) + many Barracks (unlimited)
- **Resource hoard:** Prioritize Mines (unlimited) + Vaults (limited) + Forges (limited)
- **Magic powerhouse:** Prioritize Nexus (limited) + Summoning (limited) + Alchemy (unlimited after research)
- **Breeding focus:** Prioritize Breeding Pits (max 2) + Spawning Pools (max 3) + Training (unlimited)

No strategy is "locked out," but each has different bottlenecks and strengths.

# Room Catalog

## Tier 1 Rooms (Starting Resources)

# Room Placement & Connection System

## Grid-Based Placement

**Dungeon Grid:**
- Each floor is a 20x20 grid of tiles
- Rooms occupy multiple tiles based on their tetromino shape
- Rooms CANNOT overlap or be rotated
- Must be placed on valid empty grid space

**Tetromino Shapes:**
- **Square 2x2:** Occupies a 2x2 area (4 tiles)
- **Square 3x3:** Occupies a 3x3 area (9 tiles)
- **Square 4x4:** Occupies a 4x4 area (16 tiles)
- **L-shaped:** Occupies 4 tiles in an L configuration (like Tetris L-piece)
- **T-shaped:** Occupies 4 tiles in a T configuration (like Tetris T-piece)
- **I-shaped (1x4):** Occupies 4 tiles in a straight line
- **T-shaped (3x3):** Occupies 7 tiles (3x3 with two corners missing)
- **T-shaped (3x4):** Occupies 9 tiles in a T configuration

## Connection Methods

Rooms connect to each other through **hallways** or **direct adjacency** (with restrictions).

### Hallway System

**Basic Hallways:**
- Cost: 5 Crystals per tile
- Connect any two rooms
- Can be any length, any path (horizontal, vertical, corners allowed)
- Occupy 1 tile width
- Inhabitants/defenders can be stationed in hallways
- Traps can be placed in hallways

**Hallway Mechanics:**
- **Maximum length:** 15 tiles (prevents sprawl, encourages compact design)
- **Minimum length:** 1 tile (direct neighbor connection)
- **Corner turns:** No cost penalty, but each turn counts toward trap placement
- **Pathfinding:** Invaders choose shortest valid path to objective
- **Visibility:** Player sees all connected rooms clearly

**Hallway Upgrades (Features):**
- **Reinforced Walls** (10 Crystals) - +1 Defense, slows invaders by 1 turn
- **Secret Passages** (15 Flux) - Hidden on invader map, confuses pathfinding
- **Pit Trap** (10 Crystals) - Damages/delays first invader passing through (one-time)
- **Arrow Trap** (15 Crystals) - Damages up to 3 invaders (reusable, 1/invasion)
- **Rune Ward** (10 Flux) - Damages magic users, prevents teleportation
- **Collapsing Ceiling** (20 Crystals) - Can manually collapse to seal off section (destroys hallway)
- **Patrol Route** (Feature) - Assigned defenders automatically patrol between connected rooms
- **Teleport Rune** (25 Flux) - Instant travel for your creatures, not invaders

**Hallway Strategy:**
- Long winding hallways = more trap opportunities, slower invasions
- Short direct hallways = faster resource movement, efficient layout
- Hub-and-spoke design = one central room with many hallway connections
- Maze design = confuse invaders, multiple paths to critical rooms
- Linear design = easy to defend chokepoints

### Direct Adjacency

**When Rooms Can Connect Directly (no hallway):**
- Two rooms share at least 1 edge tile on the grid
- Player must enable "direct connection" (free, instant)
- Creates a doorway between rooms

**Direct Adjacency Benefits:**
- No hallway cost (saves Crystals)
- Faster resource/inhabitant movement
- Triggers adjacency bonuses (see room descriptions)
- Compact design (space-efficient)

**Direct Adjacency Drawbacks:**
- Invaders move through quickly (no hallway traps)
- Fear/Corruption/effects spread more easily
- Less control over defensive layers
- Harder to isolate compromised sections

**Adjacency Bonuses:**
Many rooms grant bonuses to adjacent rooms (see individual room descriptions):
- Crystal Mine + Dark Forge = Material bonus
- Mushroom Grove + Underground Lake = Growth bonus
- Library + Summoning Circle = Research breakthrough
- Soul Well spreads Corruption to adjacent rooms

**Adjacency Requirements:**
- Rooms must touch on at least 1 edge tile
- Corner-to-corner touching does NOT count as adjacent
- Diagonal connections are NOT adjacency (must share edge)

### Connection Strategy Examples

**1. Defensive Fortress (Hallway-Heavy):**
```
[Entrance]--long hallway with traps-->[Barracks]-->[Chokepoint]
                                             |
                                    [short hallway]
                                             |
                                          [Altar]
```
- Maximizes trap effectiveness
- Creates defensive layers
- Slows invader advance
- High Crystal cost for hallways

**2. Efficient Production (Adjacency-Heavy):**
```
[Mine][Mine]
[Forge][Lake]
[Grove][Grove]
```
- All rooms touch, triggering adjacency bonuses
- No hallway costs
- Fast resource movement
- Vulnerable to invasion (no defensive depth)

**3. Hybrid Design (Mixed):**
```
[Mine]--hallway-->[Forge]<--hallway--[Barracks]
  |                                      ^
direct                                   |
  |                               long trapped hallway
  v                                      |
[Grove]==========[Altar]           [Entrance]
```
- Adjacency for production synergy
- Hallways for defense
- Balanced approach

**4. Hub Design:**
```
        [Room]
           |
    [Room]-[Altar]-[Room]
           |
        [Room]
```
- Central Altar connected to everything
- Easy resource management
- Single point of failure (if Altar invaded)

**5. Layered Defense:**
```
Floor 1: [Trap Rooms]--maze of hallways-->[Decoy Vaults]
Floor 2: [Barracks]=====[Production Rooms]
Floor 3: [Altar]=====[Real Vault]=====[Throne]
```
- Sacrificial first floor
- Protected core on deep floors
- Vertical separation for security

### Connection Rules & Restrictions

**Mandatory Connections:**
- Altar must connect to at least 2 other rooms (redundancy)
- All rooms must have a valid path to the Altar (no orphaned sections)
- Entrance point (Floor 1 edge) must have path to interior

**Optional Isolation:**
- Rooms CAN be isolated (no connections) but:
  - Cannot produce resources (no workers can reach)
  - Cannot be defended (no defenders can reach)
  - Useful for "sealed" rooms (e.g., hibernating Ancient Treant, dangerous experiments)

**Connection Limits:**
- Each room can have unlimited connections
- Hallways can branch (T-junctions, 4-way intersections)
- Interconnected networks are encouraged

**Visual Representation:**
- Connected rooms: Highlighted borders show connection points
- Hallways: Visible paths on grid, show trap placements
- Unconnected rooms: Greyed out, show isolation warning

### Movement Through Connections

**Inhabitant Movement:**
- Workers move instantly between connected rooms when reassigned
- Can work in any connected room
- Fungal Network feature allows teleport between specific rooms

**Resource Flow:**
- Resources auto-distribute through connections
- Shortest path algorithm
- Can set priority rooms (resources flow there first)

**Defender Movement:**
- During invasions, defenders can move 1 room per turn through connections
- Can reinforce adjacent rooms
- Patrol hallways automatically if assigned

**Invader Movement:**
- Follow shortest path to objective through hallways
- Triggered by traps in hallways
- Can choose alternate paths if blocked

### Connection Costs Summary

| Connection Type | Cost | Build Time | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|----------------|------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Direct Adjacency | Free | Instant | Adjacency bonuses, fast movement | No defensive depth |
| Basic Hallway (per tile) | 5 Crystals | 1 minute/tile | Trap placement, control | Costs add up |
| Reinforced Hallway | +10 Crystals | +2 minutes | Extra defense | Expensive |
| Secret Passage | 15 Flux total | 5 minutes | Confuses invaders | High magic cost |
| Vertical (Stairs) | 20 Crystals | 5 minutes | Floor connection | One floor only |
| Vertical (Elevator) | 50 Crystals, 20 Flux | 10 minutes | Multi-floor fast travel | High maintenance |
| Vertical (Portal) | 100 Flux, 30 Essence | 15 minutes | Instant travel, any floors | Corruption risk |

# Inhabitants

## Design Philosophy
- Each inhabitant has base traits + conditional modifiers
- No inhabitant is optimal for just one room
- Fear and hunger create dynamic decision-making
- Unique inhabitants provide dungeon-wide effects

## Inhabitant Role System

All inhabitants can fulfill multiple roles, but with varying effectiveness. There are no hard "classes" - instead, each creature has **role affinities** based on their traits and stats.

### The Three Core Roles

**1. Worker**
**2. Defender**
**3. Specialist**

Every inhabitant can be assigned to any role, but their effectiveness varies dramatically.

---

### Role 1: WORKER

**Definition:** Inhabitants stationed in production/utility rooms to generate resources.

**How It Works:**
- Assign inhabitant to any room
- They contribute to that room's base production
- Effectiveness = Base Production × (1 + Worker Efficiency Bonus)
- Can be stationed in multiple rooms if creature has "multi-task" trait

**Worker Efficiency Calculation:**

```
Final Production = Room Base Production × (1 + Trait Bonuses) × (1 + Room Synergy) × Fear Modifier × Hunger Modifier
```

**Example:**
- Crystal Mine base: 5 Crystals/min
- Station Kobold (Miner +20%): 5 × 1.20 = 6 Crystals/min
- If adjacent to Forge (Material Synergy +30%): 6 × 1.30 = 7.8 Crystals/min
- If Kobold is scared (Stress-eater, +10%): 7.8 × 1.10 = 8.58 Crystals/min
- If Kobold is hungry (Slogging, -50%): 8.58 × 0.50 = 4.29 Crystals/min

**Best Workers By Room Type:**

| Room Type | Best Workers | Efficiency Bonus |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Crystal Mine | Kobold, Stone Elemental | +20-40% |
| Mushroom Grove | Myconid, Dryad | +20-30% |
| Shadow Library | Lich, Wraith, Beholder | +20-40% |
| Soul Well | Lich, Wraith | +30% spawn rate |
| Dark Forge | Stone Elemental, Orc, Goblin | +20-30% |
| Alchemy Lab | Goblin, Imp | +20% |
| Training Grounds | Orc, Gargoyle | +30% training speed |
| Summoning Circle | Lich, Demon Lord | -20% summon cost |
| Treasure Vault | Mimic, Dragon | +50% gold generation |
| Underground Lake | Slime, Myconid | +25% |

**Workers That Work Anywhere:**
- **Slime:** 70% base efficiency in ANY room (versatile)
- **Mimic:** 80% base efficiency in ANY room (shapeshifter)
- **Skeleton:** 90% base efficiency (tireless), but +1 Fear to room

---

### Role 2: DEFENDER

**Definition:** Inhabitants assigned to defensive positions to fight invaders.

**How It Works:**
- Assign inhabitant to Barracks, hallway, or defensive position in room
- They fight when invaders enter their zone
- Combat effectiveness = Base Combat Power + Combat Bonuses
- Can patrol between connected rooms if assigned to hallway

**Combat Stats (Every Inhabitant Has These):**

```
Combat Power = (HP × Attack) / (Defense Factor)
```

- **HP (Hit Points):** How much damage they can take (10-100)
- **Attack:** Damage dealt per turn (1-20)
- **Defense:** Damage reduction (0-10)
- **Speed:** Initiative/turn order (1-10)
- **Special Abilities:** Unique combat effects

**Example Combat Stats:**

| Creature | HP | Attack | Defense | Speed | Combat Power |
|----------|-----|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Goblin | 15 | 3 | 1 | 6 | 45 (weak) |
| Kobold | 12 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 24 (very weak) |
| Skeleton | 20 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 100 (average) |
| Myconid | 10 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 10 (pitiful) |
| Orc | 40 | 10 | 4 | 5 | 400 (strong) |
| Gargoyle | 60 | 8 | 7 | 3 | 480 (very strong) |
| Wraith | 25 | 12 | 2 | 8 | 300 (strong, fast) |
| Lich | 50 | 15 | 5 | 6 | 750 (very strong) |
| Dragon | 200 | 30 | 15 | 4 | 6000 (legendary) |
| Medusa | 80 | 25 | 8 | 7 | 2000 (legendary) |

**Combat Modifiers:**

- **Fear Bonus:** If stationed in High Fear room, defenders get +2 Attack (invaders hesitate)
- **Terrain Bonus:** Hallway defenders get +20% damage (ambush advantage)
- **Numbers Advantage:** For each allied defender in same room, +5% damage (stacks, max 5 allies)
- **Equipment Bonus:** If Dark Forge has crafted equipment, +2 Attack, +1 Defense
- **Training Bonus:** If trained in Training Grounds, +1 Attack, +10% HP (permanent, max 3 stacks)
- **Fear Immunity:** Creatures with Fearless trait ignore enemy fear effects
- **Special Abilities:** See individual creature descriptions

**Defender Effectiveness Tiers:**

- **Poor Defenders (<50 Combat Power):** Goblin, Kobold, Myconid, Slime, Imp
  - These should primarily be workers, only fight as last resort
  
- **Average Defenders (50-200 Combat Power):** Skeleton, Stone Elemental, Dryad
  - Can hold defensive positions, but not frontline troops
  
- **Good Defenders (200-500 Combat Power):** Orc, Gargoyle, Wraith, Mimic
  - Primary defensive force, station in Barracks
  
- **Elite Defenders (500-1500 Combat Power):** Lich, Beholder, Demon Lord
  - Powerful guardians, but expensive to maintain
  
- **Legendary Defenders (1500+ Combat Power):** Dragon, Medusa, Ancient Treant
  - Game-changing defenders, can hold entire floors alone

**Defender Assignment Strategy:**

**Option A: Dedicated Defenders**
- Station combat-focused creatures in Barracks only
- They don't produce resources, but always ready for combat
- Best for: Orc, Gargoyle, trained Skeletons

**Option B: Dual-Role Workers/Defenders**
- Station creatures in production rooms near defensive zones
- During invasion, they can be "called to arms" (takes 1 turn to move)
- Best for: Skeleton (works at night, defends during day invasions)

**Option C: Patrol Assignments**
- Assign creatures to hallways
- They patrol between connected rooms
- Automatically engage invaders in patrol zone
- Best for: Wraith (intangible, can patrol anywhere), Gargoyle (stone form when idle)

**Option D: Room Guards**
- Station powerful defenders IN critical rooms (Altar, Vault, Throne)
- They work AND defend simultaneously (but at -20% efficiency for both)
- Best for: Mimic (in Vault), Dragon (in Throne), Beholder (in Library)

---

### Role 3: SPECIALIST

**Definition:** Inhabitants with unique abilities that trigger under specific conditions.

**How It Works:**
- Specialists aren't assigned specifically - their abilities are PASSIVE or CONDITIONAL
- They activate automatically when conditions are met
- Can stack with Worker or Defender role

**Specialist Types:**

**A. Fusion Catalyst:**
- Required for specific creature fusions
- Example: Lich required to fuse Wraith + Skeleton → Death Knight

**B. Research Enabler:**
- Unlocks special research trees
- Example: Station Lich in Library → Unlock Lichdom research
- Example: Station Demon Lord in Summoning Circle → Unlock Demonic Pacts

**C. Dungeon-Wide Aura:**
- Provides passive bonuses to entire dungeon (or entire floor)
- Example: Dragon in Throne → +200% Gold generation dungeon-wide
- Example: Ancient Treant → +100% Food production dungeon-wide

**D. Event Trigger:**
- Enables special events or mechanics
- Example: Medusa can petrify invaders (capture as statues, permanent)
- Example: Beholder reveals hidden features across dungeon

**E. Resource Converter:**
- Can transform one resource into another
- Example: Slime consumes waste, gains traits from what it eats
- Example: Imp causes random events (can produce any resource randomly)

**F. Fear Manipulator:**
- Changes fear levels in rooms
- Example: Skeleton generates +1 Fear wherever stationed
- Example: Dryad reduces Fear by -2 in stationed room + adjacent rooms
- Example: Medusa generates +3 Fear in stationed room + adjacent rooms

**G. Corruption Manipulator:**
- Generates or cleanses Corruption
- Example: Demon Lord generates +10 Corruption/min
- Example: Ancient Treant cleanses -10 Corruption/min
- Example: Dryad cleanses -2 Corruption/min in stationed room

**Specialists in Practice:**

**Example 1: The Lich**
- **Worker Role:** Stations in Shadow Library, +40% Research (excellent worker)
- **Defender Role:** 750 Combat Power (elite defender)
- **Specialist Abilities:**
  - Enables Lichdom research (unique tree)
  - Provides +10% efficiency to all undead in dungeon (aura)
  - Required for Wraith + Lich → Archlich fusion
  - Respawns if Phylactery exists (immortality mechanic)

**Example 2: The Slime**
- **Worker Role:** Works at 70% in ANY room (versatile worker)
- **Defender Role:** 30 Combat Power (poor defender)
- **Specialist Abilities:**
  - Absorbs waste products (cleans up corruption in non-dark rooms)
  - Gains traits from consumed materials (adaptability)
  - Can split into 2 lesser slimes (reproduction)
  - Required for many hybrid fusions (base genetic material)

**Example 3: The Dragon**
- **Worker Role:** Terrible worker (consumes 50 Gold/day, doesn't produce)
- **Defender Role:** 6000 Combat Power (legendary, can solo invasions)
- **Specialist Abilities:**
  - +200% Gold generation dungeon-wide (must be in Throne or Vault)
  - +5 Fear to entire floor (terrifying presence)
  - Attracts high-tier invasions (greed-motivated)
  - Can trigger "Dragon's Hoard" victory condition

---

## Role Assignment UI & Mechanics

**Assignment Interface:**

When clicking an inhabitant, player sees:

```
[GOBLIN #7]
Current Assignment: Crystal Mine (Worker)
  → Production: 6 Crystals/min (+20% efficiency)
  
Roles Available:
  [Worker] - Currently Active
  [Defender] - Combat Power: 45 (Poor)
  [Specialist] - None
  
Reassign to:
  [ ] Crystal Mine (Worker) ← Currently here
  [ ] Barracks (Defender)
  [ ] Hallway A-B (Patrol)
  [ ] Dark Forge (Worker)
  [ ] Alchemy Lab (Worker, +20% efficiency!)
```

**Multi-Role Assignment:**

Most creatures can only be in ONE role at a time, but some exceptions:

- **Room Guard:** Creature in production room also defends that room (both roles at -20% efficiency)
- **Patrol:** Creature in hallway can work in connected rooms during non-invasion times
- **Specialist:** Always active regardless of other role assignments

**Assignment Limits Per Room:**

- Most rooms have max inhabitant cap (2-6 depending on room)
- Upgrades can increase cap (+1 or +2 max inhabitants)
- Features can add +1 slot (e.g., Coffins for undead)
- Over-staffing is not allowed (prevents spam)

---

## Role Optimization vs. Flexibility

**Design Goal:** No creature should be "the best" at only ONE thing.

**Examples of Multi-Role Viability:**

**Skeleton:**
- **Worker:** 90% base efficiency (good in most rooms), +20% at night
- **Defender:** 100 Combat Power (average, but fearless)
- **Specialist:** Generates +1 Fear, can be mass-produced from Soul Well
- **Conclusion:** Excellent generalist, useful in many strategies

**Kobold:**
- **Worker:** +20% Mining (best miner), +20% Trap Workshop
- **Defender:** 24 Combat Power (terrible)
- **Specialist:** +5% efficiency per adjacent Kobold (pack bonus)
- **Conclusion:** Specialized worker, avoid combat

**Orc:**
- **Worker:** +30% Training Grounds, +20% Forge, -10% in peaceful rooms
- **Defender:** 400 Combat Power (strong), becomes Berserker when scared (+150% damage)
- **Specialist:** Forms War Bands with other Orcs (combat stack bonus)
- **Conclusion:** Combat specialist, but can work in military-themed rooms

**Myconid:**
- **Worker:** +20% Food production, spreads via Spore Network
- **Defender:** 10 Combat Power (awful, hides when scared)
- **Specialist:** Can teleport via Fungal Network, spreads passive bonuses to all Myconids
- **Conclusion:** Pure worker, never use in combat

**Gargoyle:**
- **Worker:** +20% construction speed (room upgrades), patient (low food needs)
- **Defender:** 480 Combat Power (very strong), +100% Defense in Stone Form
- **Specialist:** Can act as decoration (confuse invaders), active at night only
- **Conclusion:** Excellent defender that doesn't eat during day (stone form), works at night

**Wraith:**
- **Worker:** +20% Research, generates Corruption
- **Defender:** 300 Combat Power (strong, fast), intangible (can fight anywhere)
- **Specialist:** Feeds on fear (thrives in high-fear dungeons), can phase through walls
- **Conclusion:** Magic-focused with strong combat, prefers dark dungeons

---

## Inhabitants as Defenders: Combat Details

**Combat Turn Flow:**

1. **Initiative Phase:** Defenders and invaders roll Speed check
2. **Attack Phase:** Highest speed goes first, rolls Attack vs Enemy Defense
3. **Damage Phase:** If hit, deal (Attack - Defense) damage to enemy HP
4. **Special Ability Phase:** Some creatures trigger abilities (Medusa petrify, Wraith fear)
5. **Repeat until one side is defeated or retreats**

**Special Combat Abilities:**

- **Skeleton:** Fearless (immune to fear), Reassemble (25% chance to revive after death)
- **Orc:** Berserker Rage (when damaged below 50% HP, +100% attack, -2 defense)
- **Wraith:** Intangible (50% chance to evade physical attacks)
- **Gargoyle:** Stone Form (when idle, +100% defense, cannot attack)
- **Medusa:** Petrifying Gaze (10% chance per turn to permanently petrify invader)
- **Dragon:** Breath Weapon (hits all enemies in room, massive damage, 3-turn cooldown)
- **Lich:** Spell Master (can cast 3 spells: Death Bolt, Raise Dead, Shield)
- **Demon Lord:** Dark Pact (sacrifice Corruption to summon lesser demons mid-combat)
- **Beholder:** Anti-Magic (disables enemy magic, eye rays deal magic damage)

**Combat Example:**

```
INVASION: 3 Warriors enter Barracks

Defenders:
  - Orc (40 HP, 10 Attack, 4 Defense, Speed 5)
  - Skeleton (20 HP, 5 Attack, 3 Defense, Speed 4)
  - Skeleton (20 HP, 5 Attack, 3 Defense, Speed 4)

Invaders:
  - Warrior (30 HP, 8 Attack, 5 Defense, Speed 3)
  - Warrior (30 HP, 8 Attack, 5 Defense, Speed 3)
  - Warrior (30 HP, 8 Attack, 5 Defense, Speed 3)

Turn 1:
  - Orc attacks Warrior 1: (10 - 5) = 5 damage → Warrior 1 at 25 HP
  - Skeleton 1 attacks Warrior 1: (5 - 5) = 0 damage → Miss!
  - Skeleton 2 attacks Warrior 2: (5 - 5) = 0 damage → Miss!
  - Warrior 1 attacks Orc: (8 - 4) = 4 damage → Orc at 36 HP
  - Warrior 2 attacks Skeleton 1: (8 - 3) = 5 damage → Skeleton 1 at 15 HP
  - Warrior 3 attacks Skeleton 2: (8 - 3) = 5 damage → Skeleton 2 at 15 HP

Turn 2:
  - Orc attacks Warrior 1: (10 - 5) = 5 damage → Warrior 1 at 20 HP
  - Skeleton 1 attacks Warrior 1: (5 - 5) = 0 damage → Miss!
  - Skeleton 2 attacks Warrior 2: (5 - 5) = 0 damage → Miss!
  - Warriors counterattack...

Result: Long battle, Orc carries the team, Skeletons ineffective against armored warriors.
```

**Defender Lessons:**
- Skeletons are weak individually, strong in numbers
- Orcs excel against armored foes
- Need variety: high-attack creatures + tanky creatures + support

---

## Summary: Can Any Creature Be Anything?

**YES, but with massive effectiveness differences:**

- **Any creature can work** → Some are 10x better than others in specific rooms
- **Any creature can defend** → Combat power varies from 10 to 6000
- **Some creatures are specialists** → Unique abilities that transcend roles

**Design ensures:**
1. No "useless" creatures (even Myconid is best farmer)
2. No "does everything" creatures (even Dragon needs 50 Gold/day upkeep)
3. Strategic decisions matter (assign Orc to Barracks or Forge?)
4. Dungeon composition matters (5 Skeletons > 1 Skeleton)
5. Room placement matters (Defenders need to reach invaded rooms)

Players must balance:
- **Production needs** (workers in resource rooms)
- **Defense needs** (defenders in strategic positions)
- **Specialist bonuses** (getting unique creature benefits)
- **Upkeep costs** (feeding/maintaining inhabitants)

### Invasion Mechanics (Turn-Based)

**Movement Phase (Invaders):**
1. Invaders move 1 room per turn
2. They pathfind toward the Altar (primary objective)
3. Will detour for high-value targets (Treasure Vault, Throne Room, Soul Well)
4. Avoid high-fear rooms if possible (morale check)

**Hallway Encounters:**
- Invaders trigger ALL traps in hallway (dice roll to avoid/disarm)
- Trapped hallways slow movement by 1 turn
- Stationed guards in hallways fight as ambushes (+20% damage)

**Room Encounters:**
When invaders enter a room:

1. **Check for defenders:**
   - Count all inhabitants stationed in room
   - Count defenders from adjacent Barracks (if connected)
   - Roll initiative (invaders usually go first unless ambushed)

2. **Combat Resolution:**
   - Each combatant rolls attack (d20 + combat stat)
   - Damage dealt on hit (varies by class/creature)
   - Defenders fight until room is "cleared" or invaders defeated
   - Invaders fight until victorious or retreat (morale check)

3. **Room Victory (Invaders):**
   - Defeat all defenders OR defenders flee
   - Spend 1 turn "sacking" room (steal resources, damage features)
   - **Room Damage:** 20-40% production penalty until repaired (costs 50% original build cost)
   - **Resource Loss:** Lose 20% of stored resources in that room type
   - **Inhabitant Fate:** Killed (permanent), Captured (can rescue/ransom), or Fled (returns after invasion)

4. **Room Victory (Defenders):**
   - Defeat all invaders in room
   - Gain experience for stationed defenders
   - Loot invader equipment (Gold, items)
   - Prisoners can be captured (send to Torture Chamber or Spawning Pool)

**Fear Effects on Invaders:**
- **Low Fear Room:** No effect
- **Medium Fear Room:** Morale check (10% chance to flee)
- **High Fear Room:** Morale check (30% chance to flee), -2 to attack rolls
- **Very High Fear Room:** Morale check (50% chance to flee), -4 to attack rolls, some invaders may freeze in terror

**Morale System:**
- Invaders start with 100 morale
- Lose 10 morale per ally defeated
- Lose 5 morale per trap triggered
- Lose 15 morale in High/Very High fear rooms
- Gain 10 morale per room captured
- At 0 morale: Invaders retreat from dungeon

### Invasion Objectives

**Primary Objective (Always):**
- Reach and destroy/desecrate the Altar
- If successful: Lose 1 civilization level, must rebuild Altar (100 Crystals, 50 Gold)

4. **Magical Defense:** 
   - Use Summoning Circle to spawn temporary defenders
   - Mages in Ley Line Nexus gain massive power
   - Trap Glyphs trigger automatic spells

- High Flux generation, powerful but unstable

## Example 4: The Mining Consortium
**Rooms:** Crystal Mines + Dark Forge + Treasure Vault  
**Inhabitants:** Kobolds (Mines) + Stone Elemental (Forge) + Mimic (Vault)  
**Features:** Geothermal Vents (Forge), Storage Expansion (Vault)  
**Result:**
- Mines provide raw materials to adjacent Forge
- Forge crafts equipment enhanced by Geothermal Vents
- Vault stores wealth, Mimic defends it
- Stone Elemental boosts mining and forging
- High crystal and gold generation

# Anti-Optimization Mechanics Summary

1. **Fear Cascades:** High-fear creatures are powerful but disrupt neighbors
2. **Resource Competition:** Multiple currencies needed simultaneously
3. **Conditional Bonuses:** "Best" inhabitant changes with context
4. **Adjacency Puzzles:** Room placement matters but optimal layout varies
5. **Day/Night Shifts:** Different creatures excel at different times
6. **Seasonal Variance:** Optimal strategy changes every 7 days
7. **Floor Depth Trade-offs:** Deeper = more resources but harder to manage
8. **Corruption Double-Edge:** Power comes with risks
9. **Fusion Costs:** Combining creatures is expensive, requires planning
10. **Invasion Scaling:** Success brings harder challenges
11. **Reputation Conflicts:** Can't maximize all reputation types
12. **Biome Restrictions:** Some strategies impossible in some biomes

# Final Notes

This design creates multiple viable strategies:
- **Undead horde** (Corruption focus)
- **Wealthy merchant dungeon** (Gold focus)
- **Research institute** (Knowledge focus)
- **Peaceful commune** (Harmony focus)
- **Chaotic laboratory** (Experimental focus)

No single approach dominates because:
- Each has unique challenges
- Resources compete for investment
- Reputation affects available options
- Environmental factors shift viability
- Creatures have conditional synergies, not absolute bests

The game rewards creativity and adaptation over optimization.
